PURPOSE

This is an open-source application for anyone who wants to make progress on anything important to them with the Objectives & Key Results planning model used by numerous big names in tech like Google, Twitter, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Intel (ground-zero for OKRs!), etc. I'll probably incorporate some ideas and approaches from the Entrepreneurial Operating System for building companies and Basecamp's Shape Up methodology for shipping software because I really like these models.

Here's a list of companies using OKRs if you're curious:
https://www.atiim.com/blog/top-companies-that-use-okrs/

In MVP or MLP, users will be able to:

1. Create an account, update email/password, login and logout
2. Learn OKR basics with a brief Quick Start README
3. Add Objectives with appetite (i.e. timeframe) for achievement
4. Add Key Results with appetite (i.e. timeframe) for achievement
5. Add custom labels to each objective in a way that indicates what (e.g. a project, department, strategic initiative, or whatever) or who the objective belongs to
6. Mark Objectives and Key Results complete

Future version might allow users to:

1. Cascade OKRs
2. Assign OKRs to others
3. Visualize progress on OKRs with something like the Shape Up methodologies Hill Map (identify stages and color code)
4. Receive rewards/feedback upon achievement of OKRs
5. Integrate with other relevant applications (e.g. Slack, Facebook, or whatever)

NOTES

Structure your project first
Before you start building, write out what you want it to do. Have specific user stories written, for example: “Users can play audio when they click on the audio player button”, “Users can log in using their email and password as well as just using Facebook”.

Your code has to have a basic structure too, before you begin writing it. Write in pseudocode — basically just explain in words what each part of the application or the project code will do.

Basic example:
// When user opens a page, grab their location
// Send a request to the weather API site with the location
// Receive data
// Display the degrees on the page
// Change background image of the page to reflect the current weather

Don’t overdo it, there is no need to write out every little thing your code will be doing in pseudocode first, but do have the main parts laid out.

The best example I can provide you with is: remember when you were writing essays in school, you had to structure them first, for instance, an intro with your opinion on the subject, 3 main points in support of your opinion, and a conclusion.

This will help you anticipate potential problems and improve the quality of your code.

Try to find real developers, or people who are also still learning, but are already a little more advanced than you are. Ask them to review your code and provide their feedback. What you can improve? What works? What doesn’t?
